					<h3>Interest in IT:</h3>
					<p>Im interested into IT and i want to find a IT related job in the future, my interest into IT starts around high school time when i attend one of the game design class. 
					I choose to come to RMIT because i think i can learn all the required skills and maybe IT experiences so im ready for future jobs.</p>

					<p>The job i currently think that is idea for me is the software engineer position for game development, game is my greatest hobby and i really want to be one of the members that makes the game one day. </p>
					<p>There are a lot of skill that are required when applying for this position. Able to use C++ programming is the base requirement,
					especially in gaming areas. The position also requires the applier has a great understanding and experience into math, 3D graphics, game engines and user interface.</p>
					<p>The only experience i have is the basic understanding of C++ which is very far away from meeting the requirements.</p>
					<p>My plan to obtain my skill is to complete my university courses and maybe take part time jobs that allows me to gain experiences related to IT, 
					i can also look for tutorials online and practise free gaming engines myself.</p>

				<h3>Project idea:</h3>
			</header>			  
			<p>My project idea is about developing a game using engine like unity, 
As a huge gamer myself, i like to play a lot of games, it motivates me to create i actual game myself, i always wanted to be able to play a game that has been developed by me, 
			i think the project can be very interesting and useful, the project may help me to develop the skills, experiences and knowledge i need to be qualified for my ideal job. 
My idea for the game is to create a 3d rpg game. </p>
			<p>The tools required are really just the unity 3d engine itself and a computer that is able to meet the basic requirements of the software. 
			There are a few requirements for developing the project,  having a great understanding at programming such as c is the most important, able to use the game engine, for this project ive choose to use unity as the engine so i have to understand how does the engine work, 
			and i have to use asset store smartly so i can save alot of effort and maybe find new ideas. I also have to knowledge onto 3d graphics since this is a 3d game. It could take a long period of time to learn and gain all the required skills. If the project is successful, 
			it will give me a huge advantage when applying for game development related jobs because it helps me learn and practice all the necessary skills i need.</p>
